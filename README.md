# To-predict-Persistence-13M-Payment-Behaviour-using-Machine-Learning-Approach

The insurance industry of India has 57 insurance companies , 24 of which are in the life insurance business and the remaining 33 are non-life insurers..Overall market size is US$ 280 billion and  premiums as % of Indiaâ€™s GDP is increasing and the industry is expected to increase by 14-15% annually for the next 3-5 years .

Accurately predicting customer churn is critical to long-term success of the business. Accurate prediction of churn probability drives proactive customer marketing, sales forecasting, churn-sensitive pricing models,etc. False prediction and inappropriate retaining measures can incur loss as well as risk losing existing customers. The goal is to not only predict but also prevent churn.

This project aims to use machine learning techniques to find an efficient and effective solution to identifying customers likely to churn and retaining them without incurring loss from false positives and false negatives .The use of uplifting modeling provides us with customer types such as Persuadable, Lost Causes, Sleeping Dogs and Sure Things. This helps prevent wasted efforts on retaining the wrong customer, instead only approach  persudable customers .


Objective :

Prepare a Machine Learning Model to predict the Persistency 13M Payment Behaviour

Identify the segments where maximum non payers are captured and relate plausible reasons for non-payers

Perform uplift modeling to identify definite churners and persudable churners
